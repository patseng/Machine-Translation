1) We chose to work with Spanish. Spanish is similar to English in many ways, though there are still many differences. Word order is a key difference, as Spanish flips the English order for many parts of speech (e.g.
noun-adj, direct/indirect obj-verb, etc). Some Spanish words, particularly prepositions, can have a wide variety of meanings based on the context in which they are used (e.g. por, para, a). Some very important words have
multiple meanings that are just as common as one another (e.g. "fue" means "was" and also "went"). There are also very many atomic phrases in Spanish, where the meaning of the phrase is not even close to the sum of its parts. 
In addition, in Spanish, nouns can be implied (that is, absorbed by the verb).  In spanish, reflexive verbs and the passive or impersonal voice are syntactically similar but semantically quite different.  Verbs are reflexive when the subject and the object of the sentence.  In Spanish, the reflexive pronoun "se" appears after a third person and before the reflexive verb. The reflexive pronoun can also slightly alter the meaning of the verb. However, the same "se" is used frequently when Spanish is written with a passive voice.  Consequently, the use of direct translation for the word 'se' poses numerous difficulties.

2) The original test document:

Los Mochis, Sinaloa.- El día de mañana, el vuelo de la compañía Volaris que sale del Aeropuerto Internacional del Valle del Fuerte con cede en Los Mochis y cuyo destino es la ciudad de Tijuana, Baja California, fue cancelado sin previo aviso.
Personal del puerto aéreo confirmó que no se trata de la cancelación de la ruta en general, sino de ese vuelo específico y solamente por esta ocasión.

El director de Economía del Ayuntamiento de Ahome, Mauricio Duarte Martínez, confirmó la información a través de la gerencia de la compañía.

De hecho, el funcionario municipal comentó que se le informó que se trata de una operación que realiza la aerolínea en sus unidades aéreas y que está relacionada con las matrículas que portan las aeronaves.

"No se cancela la ruta, es solo el vuelo de mañana, el que sale a Tijuana", manifestó.
De hecho, Duarte Martínez indicó que sería muy difícil que la ruta fuera cancelada, puesto que recientemente tenido algún acercamiento con varios empresarios del ramo y tuvo información de que hay demanda de más vuelos y no de menos.
Reporteros de esta casa editorial se comunicaron a los teléfonos de la aerolínea para solicitar más detalles respecto a este suceso.

Sin embargo, el personal a cargo de indicó que no contaban con las facultades para facilitar información debido a algunos reglamentos internos de la compañía.

Se proporcionó una dirección de correo electrónico para solicitar la información, pero no se logró obtener ninguna respuesta en tiempo, por lo que probablemente esta fue también la misma situación que vivieron algunos viajeros que quedaron varados sin su vuelo.

No obstante, el hecho de la cancelación del vuelo pudo ser corroborado por el mismo personal.

4) Rules:

Rule 1:
  In spanish, it is often the case the adjective follow verbs.  In English, adjectives typically preface nouns.  Thus when we encounter a noun followed by a adjective, we swap the two words.

Rule 2:
  In spanish, reflexive verbs and the passive or impersonal voice are syntactically similar but semantically quite different.  Verbs are reflexive when the subject and the object of the sentence.  In Spanish, the reflexive pronoun "se" appears after a third person and before the reflexive verb. The reflexive pronoun can also slightly alter the meaning of the verb. However, the same "se" is used frequently when Spanish is written with a passive voice.  Consequently, the use of direct translation for the word 'se' poses numerous difficulties.  

Rule 3:
  In spanish a modal verb followed by an infinitive verb is common.  However, in English sentences with this structure don't make sense.  Consider for example, "He may to run" or "I must to change this sentence". In these scenarios, we remove the 'to' so that the modal verb is not followed by an infinitive.

Rule 4:
  In spanish is prepositions often appear before infinitives.  Sentences like "Esto es para solicitar" when translated directly result in a english sounds awkward.  Consider the translation: "This is for to solicit".  Removing the preposition before the infinitive results in a more fluent sentence: "This is to solicit".

Rule 8:
  In spanish the phrase "lo que" occurs quite frequently.  This is part of a set of phrases called relative pronoun which are the combination of one of "el", "la", "los", "las", "lo" followed by "que" or "cual"
        # rule 8 - removal of a determiner followed by a wh-determiner such as "the that"


JUNK BELOW:
In Spanish reflexive verbs occur in a different format than reflexive verbs in english.  The reflexive pronoun often occurs before the verb such "Me llamo Peter." In English, this sentence would be translated as "I call myself Peter." In our source text, the
